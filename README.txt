Lettergame
----------

This is *Lettergame*, the game with a boring name.  And honestly, the game
isn't all that exciting, either.  I wrote it for my not-quite-two-year-old
son, who seems quite entertained by it, but it's not really meant for
anyone who has an attention span.  Or standards.

The game
--------

Type a letter and see it come zooming at you on screen!  Click the mouse
and see an expanding circle!  Click the cat and here it meow!

Really, that's it.

The nice thing about this, from my perspective as a parent, is that it runs
on both my Linux and MacOS X systems and, in full screen mode, is generally
sufficient to prevent Max from accidentally deleting files, creating
gibberish address book entries, or inadvertently starting a global
thermonuclear war.

Hotkeys
-------

ALT-F toggles full screen mode.  ESC exits.
